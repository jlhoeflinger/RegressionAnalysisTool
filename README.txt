Please follow the format as shown in the two sample input datasets.  The formatting is quite strict to that standard.  More work could be done to accept a variety of formatting for datasets.  
Please contact us at <dan.hoeflinger@gmail.com> for help troubleshooting problems.


A requirements.txt file is supplied and should install all necessary libraries.  Use the following commannd in a terminal to install them:

pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the code with the example datasets run the following (in an ipython terminal):

import GrowthCurveModeler as gcm
gcm.GrowthCurveModeler('Growth Curve Sample Data Set 1.xlsx', Threshold=0.2)
gcm.GrowthCurveModeler('Growth Curve Sample Data Set 2.xlsx', Threshold=0.2)



To use the new metadata + raw data mode, please use the following (in an ipython terminal):

import GrowthCurveModeler as gcm
gcm.GrowthCurveModeler('ExampleRawData.xlsx', MetaDataFile='ExampleMetaData.xlsx')



Please read the docstring for explanation on how to use the optional arguments.  Example raw and metadata files will be added soon as an example.
